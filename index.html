        Hello, my name is Elijah Selassie. I am a new dual enrollment student at Cerritos College, I have been participating since the second semester of last year. I currently attend Whitney High, next year I will be a high school freshman. I am also taking CIS 103, Computer Programming Logic. I am very excited to attend this class and learn about making websites and code.
